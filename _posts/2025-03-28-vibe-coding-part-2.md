## Vibe coding!!! Part 2

This is part 2 of my experience with Vibe Coding. I had fewer blockers this time but less satisfaction!

If you want to know what happened in part 1 watch the [video](https://youtu.be/HWfvYqiznZ8) and read the article [summary](https://uittorio.github.io/blog/2025/03/27/vibe-coding-part-1.html)

### What did I do this time
I've simplified the application to only record some text in a file storage.
I've also added the ability to change date. Unfortunately I stopped the recording here I've also added another section to add actions!
You can find everything in the [repo](https://github.com/uittorio/reflect).

## Vibe coding or not?
I didn't learn anything about coding during this session. This is probably not the way to do vibe coding if you are a software engineer.

At the end of the session, I read through the code and realized that it was taking me a long time to understand what was happening. 
I can imagine a process where you keep feeding the AI, but you review the code as it is generated. 
The AI could do the heavy lifting: finding the best libraries, simplifying some algorithms, and giving you some shortcuts while you think about the bigger picture.

I feel more fulfilled creating a product with a group of people! Maybe I should try software teaming with AI.
